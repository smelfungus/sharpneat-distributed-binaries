Cart and Pole Balancing Task, with two poles.

Two vertically upright poles are attached with hinges to a cart on a track that runs horizontally. 

The goal is to keep both poles balanced, i.e., maintain the poles in an upright position, by applying a horizontal force to the cart.

The poles have different length and mass, otherwise the task would be impossible.

The cart and pole task is a classical benchmark problem in control theory and reinforcement learning, also known as the inverted pendulum, or pole/stick/broom balancing task.
