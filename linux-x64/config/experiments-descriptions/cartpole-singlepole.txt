Cart and Pole Balancing Task, with a Single Pole.

A vertically upright pole is attached via a hinge to a cart on a track that runs horizontally. 

The goal is to keep the pole balanced, i.e., maintain the pole in an upright position, by applying a horizontal force to the cart.

The cart and pole task is a classical benchmark problem in control theory and reinforcement learning, also known as the inverted pendulum, or pole/stick/broom balancing task.
