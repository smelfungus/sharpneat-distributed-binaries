A prey and an agent each occupy a single square within a 24x24 grid of squares. The agent must catch the prey.

The prey is controlled by simple stochastic rules, with probability of moving away from the agent increasing with proximity.

The agent is controlled by the evolved neural network, with eight radial sensor inputs for detecting the prey, and four motor outputs for move north, east, south and west.

Each trial consists of a configurable number of timesteps. If the agent catches the prey within the available timesteps it scores 1 and the trial ends, otherwise the trial ends at the last timestep and the agent scores zero.

The agent is trialled N times to achieve a score between 0 and N.

Task difficulty can be varied by adjusting:
 - Number of 'head start' moves for the prey.
 - Prey speed.
 - Max number of timesteps.
 - Agent sensor range.
