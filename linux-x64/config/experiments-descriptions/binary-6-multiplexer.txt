Binary 6-Multiplexer Task.

A neural net has 6 inputs, two are address inputs, and four are data inputs. All of the inputs accept a binary value (zero or one).

There is a single output.

A binary address is presented to the two address inputs, and this indicates which of the four data inputs values are to be selected for the output.

Evaluation consists of exhaustively evaluating the network against each of the 64 (2^6) possible input combinations. For each evaluation, the output value must match the value being presented to the data input selected by the address inputs.

An output less than 0.5 is considered a binary 0 response, and >=0.5 a binary 1. However, fitness at each evaluation is on a continuous linear scale, and these are summed across all evaluations to give a maximum possible fitness of 64.

An additional fitness of 1000 is added to the total if all 64 test cases are passed, giving a maximum possible fitness of 1064.

This task consists of two major subtasks:

1) Decode a 2-bit binary address value to a simple 4-bit address code, consisting of one bit per address, with a single address bit high and all other bits low.
2) Use the simple 4-bit address to select the corresponding data input.
