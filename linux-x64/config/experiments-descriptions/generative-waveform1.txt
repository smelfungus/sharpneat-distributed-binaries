Generative Function Regression - Waveform #1

A neural net has a single input and a single output. The single input is fixed at a value of 1.0.

The net is assumed to be cyclic, as it is activated over N timesteps, and the goal is for the single output to describe the target waveform, matching its amplitude, wavelength, and phase.

The target waveform is as follows:

   y = sin(x + sin(x))

Evaluated over the x interval [0, 8*PI]
